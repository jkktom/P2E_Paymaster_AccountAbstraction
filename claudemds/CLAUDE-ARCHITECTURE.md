- **Reduced Complexity**: No password management or email verification
- **Better Security**: Delegated authentication to Google's infrastructure
- **Smart Wallet Integration**: Automatic zkSync wallet creation during signup
- **User Convenience**: Single sign-on experience with immediate blockchain access
- **Privacy Compliance**: Leverages Google's GDPR compliance
- **JWT Enhancement**: Smart wallet addresses included in authentication tokens

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Token Strategy:
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
- **Scalable**: Easy horizontal scaling without session affinity
- **Flexible**: Custom claims for user permissions and wallet address
- **Secure**: Short expiration with refresh token rotation

#### API Security Patterns:
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of point earning and exchange endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Spring Boot annotations  
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: JPA parameterized queries by default
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted cross-origin requests

### Blockchain Security

#### Smart Contract Security:
- **OpenZeppelin**: Use of audited, battle-tested contract libraries
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for contract functions
- **Reentrancy Guards**: Protection against common attack vectors
- **Upgrade Patterns**: Proxy contracts for future improvements
