# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a blockchain project repository for developing a goods exchange service with the following components:
- Web2-based point system
- Blockchain-based governance token with voting functionality on Ethereum
- Fixed-rate exchange between points and tokens
- Web application for testing all functionality

## Repository Structure

The repository contains a single project located in `jkktom-blockchain-test/` directory. Currently, the project consists only of requirements documentation and needs implementation.

## Development Requirements

Based on the project requirements:
- Target blockchain: Ethereum mainnet
- Must implement both Web2 point system and blockchain token system
- Governance token must support voting functionality
- Web application interface required for testing
- All code must be executable for assignment evaluation
- Test cases should be included
- Code should document language, framework, coding style, and development environment choices

## Current State

The repository is in initial state with only a README.md file containing Korean-language project requirements. No implementation code, build system, or development environment has been established yet.

## Next Steps for Development

When implementing this project, consider:
- Setting up appropriate blockchain development environment (likely Hardhat, Truffle, or Foundry for Ethereum)
- Choosing web framework for the application interface
- Implementing smart contracts for governance token with voting
- Creating Web2 backend for point system
- Establishing testing framework and test cases
- Setting up deployment configuration
